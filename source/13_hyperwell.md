# Gateways in Distributed Systems

> This will most likely be an argumentation why we need P2P gateways when working with P2P data in academia: Many platforms and tools are built with web technologies and hence are subject to the quasi-centralized architecture of the HTTP web.

## Bridging Into The Web
Web applications leverage technologies planned, audited, and released by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). These technologies are known as _web technologies_ and are commonly supported by web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and macOS Safari. Web applications are a popular way of providing tools and services, as opposed to native applications executed directly by the user’s operating system, due to three factors:
* User Experience (UX): Websites are accessible by entering Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) such as `https://www.eff.org/`. Users don’t have to manually download an application bundle and run it on their machine, as browsers download the application code and assets in-promptu.
* Developer Experience (DX): Developers can choose from a variety of standardized, open technologies for realizing their applications: Building web documents with HTML, realizing complex business logics with JavaScript, 
* Business Benefits: ...

# Gateways and P2P Systems

Each aspect of a P2P system bears implications for usability, data availability, and user emancipation: As described in the previous chapters, P2P networks can effectively use certain network structures to enforce power structures and hierarchies among peers. 


# Design & Implementation of Hyperwell

## Resource Exhaustion: A “Think” Peer
> Describe issues with the first iteration of Hyperwell, where the Gateway API was residing in each and every peer.

## Institutional Gateways

## Notebook: Local-First, Personal Annotations
> If there’s enough time to realize the local notebook application, write a small chapter about it here.

## Adopting Hyperwell in Existing Environments
> Explicate how our approach on adding Hyperwell support to the Recogito semantic annotation platform went.
