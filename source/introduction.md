# Introduction

The Master's thesis I conduct at Leipzig University in 2019 concerns the general idea of establishing peer-to-peer (P2P) workflows in Digital Humanities (DH) research. Data validity, automatic versioning, enhanced privacy, and facilitated collaboration are just several prospects of well-designed P2P networks, all of which can be favourable for the Digital Humanities: A young, fast-paced, and inherently digital field (Hunyadi, 2016).
