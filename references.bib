  abstract = {Decentralized identifiers ({DIDs}) are a new type of identifier to provide verifiable, decentralized digital identity. These new identifiers are designed to enable the controller of a {DID} to prove control over it and to be implemented independently of any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority. {DIDs} are {URLs} that relate a {DID} subject to a {DID} document allowing trustable interactions with that subject. {DID} documents are simple documents describing how to use that specific {DID}. Each {DID} document can express cryptographic material, verification methods, or service endpoints, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a {DID} controller to prove control of the {DID}. Service endpoints enable trusted interactions with the {DID} subject.

This document specifies a common data model, a {URL} format, and a set of operations for {DIDs}, {DID} documents, and {DID} methods.},

In some ways, {IPFS} is similar to the Web, but {IPFS} could be seen as a single {BitTorrent} swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository. In other words, {IPFS} provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyper links. This forms a generalized Merkle {DAG}, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web. {IPFS} combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. {IPFS} has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.},

  abstract = {One of the challenges in introducing computing to practitioners in the humanities is to explain how digital scholarship relates to the traditions of scholarly work to which they are accustomed. The very terminology is problematical. Humanities scholars do not very often compute; but many of them do categorise and analyse, and those are aspects that they can appreciate. Such markup is not essential, as is clear from some of the oldest documents. Greek inscriptions were commonly presented all in capitals, with no breaks between words. Fixed numbers make possible systems of analysis, lexica or concordances. The Hebrew Bible, had for centuries been presented in verses, which were demarcated by the system of accentuation. The digital publication of inscriptions and papyri is now gathering pace, using Text Encoding Initiative ({TEI})-compliant {XML} to represent the many nuances that papyrologists and epigraphers wish to express.},

These mechanisms pena{\textasciitilde}ise information providers, presuppose relevance to the recipient, and make access difficult, We discuss a study of shared editor use which suggests that awareness information provided and exploited passively through the shared workspace, allows users to move smoothly between close and loose collaboration, and to assign and coordinate work dynamically. Passive awareness mechanisms promise effective support for collaboration requiring this sort of behaviour, whilst avoiding problems with active approaches.},

We identify approaches that work well in our experience, such as the functional reactive programming paradigm, and highlight areas in need of further research, such as the reliability of NAT traversal and usability challenges.},
