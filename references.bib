These new identifiers are designed to enable the controller of a {DID} to prove control over it and to be implemented independently of any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority. {DIDs} are {URLs} that relate a {DID} subject to a {DID} document allowing trustable interactions with that subject. {DID} documents are simple documents describing how to use that specific {DID}. Each {DID} document can express cryptographic material, verification methods, or service endpoints, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a {DID} controller to prove control of the {DID}. Service endpoints enable trusted interactions with the {DID} subject.

This document specifies a common data model, a {URL} format, and a set of operations for {DIDs}, {DID} documents, and {DID} methods.},

In other words, {IPFS} provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyper links. This forms a generalized Merkle {DAG}, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web. {IPFS} combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. {IPFS} has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.},
