In the following, I will discuss collaboration and peer-to-peer systems, both of which actually helped me write this thesis. I'd like to thank a few like-minded peers---physical ones, albeit sometimes connected remotely.

First and foremost, I want to thank Dr. Thomas Köntges for his supervision on this thesis. He has been influential to me on many levels, be it writing, novel technologies, or academic practice. His feedback, patience, and repeated motivation made this thesis what it is today. If it wasn't for Professor Gregory Crane, I would not actually have met Thomas Köntges; it was at the NEH 2019 workshop at Tufts University in Boston where we met first. Professor Crane puts an enormous amount of trust into his students, which sparked initial work on this thesis.

I'd furthermore like to thank Chiara Palladino, Assistant Professor at Furman University. Much to her professionalism, she suggested collaborating on the study discussed in chapter \ref{sec:study}, successfully recruited a group of students, and managed both sessions on-site (including ordering Pizza). Thanks to all participating Furman students! I've received further academic input from Dr. Rainer Simon, one of the minds behind Recogito. Dr. Jakob Voß shared his vast knowledge of Ted Nelson's work with me during HT'19 and even provided further feedback on this thesis, for which I am grateful. Edward Silverton frequently enlightened me on GLAM technology, which was a wholly new world to me.

I am also indebted to Bastian Havers, Hans Christian Schmitz, and Christofer Meinecke for their substantial feedback on my writing. The logo of Hyperwell, an asterism scanned from a 1922 edition of James Joyce's _Ulysses_, emerged from discussions with Lucas Dino Nolte, who is the best typomaniac that I know.

Much of this work is due to the emotional support of Elisa Hartmann; her loving critique and harsh encouragement. She had my back in times where I did nothing but sit and write, something I likely won't ever be able to make up for. Finally, I want to thank my family for their unwavering trust and support.
