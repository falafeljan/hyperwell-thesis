# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

This thesis' body of work concerns collaboration and peer-to-peer systems---and I certainly could not have achieved this work without a multitude of collaborators.

First and foremost, I want to thank Dr. Thomas KÃ¶ntges, my supervisor in this project. You have been influental to me on so many levels, being it writing, novel technologies, or the academic practice. Your feedback, patience, and repeated motivation made this thesis what it is today!

If it wasn't for Professor Gregory Crane, I would not actually have met Thomas: It was at the NEH 2019 workshop at Tufts University in Boston where we got to know each other. Professor Crane puts an enormous amount of trust into his students, which frequently results in astonishing projects and individual achievements---and with his trust, we achieved an invitation to said workshop, an ACM publication, as well as an initial spark for this thesis.

It has also been at said workshop where I initially met Chiara Palladino, Assistant Professor at Furman University. ... . Dr. Rainer Simon.
