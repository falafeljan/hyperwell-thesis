## Recogito

Using annotation to enhance source material with additional information is a practice commonly used in the Humanities, as it provides an environment for connecting sources with one’s personal thoughts. The emergence of digital tools in the Humanities then brought not only the likes of computational methods, but also made the social aspects of the internet more approachable to non-experts (Davidson, 2008).

This caused two particular implications. Collaboration, an artifact of particular importance in the interdisciplinary nature of Humanities research, enabled working on the same resources with multiple people involved, exchanging their findings—though, digitally—in real-time. Furthermore, the rise of the Semantic Web with Linked Data actually imposed semantic meaning on data itself: Digital entities could reference each other and describe their relations in more depth.

Recogito, a project by the Pelagios Commons, takes on to leverage Linked Data for spatial annotation. Digital gazetteers, such as the Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire (DARE, https://dh.gu.se/dare/), can be imported into Recogito and tagged from within a resource like, for example, the Iliad, exposing semantic relationships (Simon et al., 2017). A separate map view on Recogito plots these relations on a map and allows for exploring them visually. Annotations on such a resource can then be shared with fellow users, providing opportunities for further contributions.

Exploring historic artifacts in such ways provides new ways of perceiving historic information. Besides being beneficial, this could even more benefit educational programs in the Classics. We set out to explore these prospects in a user testing session, involving students at Furman University in a semi-controlled environment … 

The takeaways of this publication are two-fold: First, we present two modular dataset created by the participants during both sessions on the mentioned resources—the Iliad’s Catalog of Ships, and the Tabula Tabula Peutingeriana. They contain georeferences for many places as well as annotations relating to people, events, and general remarks. These datasets are available in various formats and can easily be imported into Recogito.

Second, we present an overview of the survey and analytics results received during the sessions, focusing on the perceived benefits of spatial annotation and collaboration, as well as the general user experience.
