# Digital Annotation {#sec:annotation}

The way we treat annotations today is wrong, and by considering how tools for annotating PDFs and websites work we can learn about the issues. Coming from the Related Work section, this chapter should give a theoretical introduction into issues of text theory and how annotations fits in there. By leveraging a comparison of OHCO and Hypertext (or, Ted Nelson’s Xanadu), we should derive an architecture for annotations, and be able to show how annotations work in the Web’s notion of hypertext.

Hypothes.is. Browser Storage APIs.

## Hypertext

Explicate Nelson’s work on Hypertext and Xanadu [@nelson1993].

## Distributed Systems and Data Ownership

> Although they let you access your data anywhere, all data access must go via the server, and you can only do the things that the server will let you do. In a sense, you don’t have full ownership of that data --- the cloud provider does. In the words of a bumper sticker: “There is no cloud, it’s just someone else’s computer.” [@kleppmann2019]

_TODO:_ Take on how hypertext systems have been considered earlier (less monopolistic?) and how the distribution of data plays along with data ownership. Even further, establish the notion of a separation between institutional and personal data (along with the ownership question). Solid by @mansour2016 will surely help to support this hypothesis (technically). Solid, however, builds upon Web ID and RFD, among other standards issued by the W3C. Within the Web, IDs still are tied to servers, which again most people aren't able to provide for themselves.

Annotations are of a personal, and even a social nature---commonly, annotations are personal notes onto something, and annotations are rarely public. Annotations are related to a profile, and just rarely made with the authority of an institution or group. Annotations enable for sophisticated discussion [@marshall1997].

_TODO:_ Cite @srnicek2017 with issues of 'digital walled gardens' and, more generally, platforms.

_TODO:_ Make a stretch towards the distinction of _personal_ and _institutional_ data.

## Prospects of Linked Data

_TODO:_ Go further from @sec:related:ld-dh and relate the prospects of Linked Data onto annotation and P2P systems. Linked Data has a point, as the Solid project of @mansour2016 shows: it allows for standardizing personal storage by exposing semantic relations of data. WebID^[webid] specification allows for distributed, standardized, and platform-less logins using the web technology stack.
