# Digital Annotation {#sec:annotation}

The way we treat annotations today is wrong, and by considering how tools for annotating PDFs and websites work we can learn about the issues. Coming from the Related Work section, this chapter should give a theoretical introduction into issues of text theory and how annotations fits in there. By leveraging a comparison of OHCO and Hypertext (or, Ted Nelson’s Xanadu), we should derive an architecture for annotations, and be able to show how annotations work in the Web’s notion of hypertext.
