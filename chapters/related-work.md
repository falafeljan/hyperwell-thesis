Considering the three aspects of this work’s research goals described in the introduction: usability, feasibility, and compatibility of a decentralized annotation system. Touching the foundation of the web as we know it today, but also notions of digital text in general, I will go into early work on Hypertext systems by Ted Nelson and others in @sec:related:hypertext, while also considering alternative approaches and early notions of digital annotation. [@Sec:related:ld; @sec:related:hypertext] will do … .

How are resources treated in the Digital Humanities? Canonical text systems such as CTS have been available for a couple of years, and IIIF is currently emerging and becoming more popular among GLAM institutions. Give an overview of some Digital Humanities tools, such as Recogito or Ugarit, to emphasize the distinction between institutional and personal research data.

## Local-First Applications

In 2019, \citeauthor{kleppmann2019} coined the term of ‘local-first applications’. In a paper called \citetitle{kleppmann2019}, 

The technologies used by this approach leverage contemporary P2P approaches. Blockchain could provide a good take on emerging high-tech, and federated systems also are of interest, if that doesn’t extend the section’s boundaries too much. Some previous attempts such as BitTorrent [@legout2007], Gnutella [@chawathe2003] and Skype [@guha2015].

> Describe the fundamental technologies first: Append-only logs [@kreps2013], Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) [@maymounkov2002], Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) [@shapiro2011; @kleppmann2017].

P2P systems are often associated with distributed networking and distributed databases. Essentially, systems such as the aforementioned BitTorrent and Gnutella construct immensely scaled, distributed, and fragmented databases that communicate over a vast worldwide network instead of a Local Area Network (LAN).

certain primitives known from highly efficient enterprise systems are applied to P2P systems,

Introduce contemporary systems that leverage these fundamentals: IPFS [@benet2014] and Dat [@robinson2018].
