# User Testing Study {#sec:study}

Clearly, mainstream achievements in the development and engineering of computers led to what we know today as the Digital Humanities. As I've outlined before, the increasing computational powers brought us Humanities Computing---computational approaches for the Humanities---as well as an overall digital practice. Yet, the capabilities of computers are not yet limited by these terms: Devices are connected via a vast digital network with an increasing throughput. Contemporary computer networks allow not just for a mere exchange of discrete information, but rather for real-time exchange of virtual spaces.

One modality of such a virtual space is video conferencing. As @hunyadi2016 notes, scheduling meetings online---with local and remote colleagues alike---has had an enormous impact on interdisciplinary collaboration in the Digital Humanities. In some academic Digital Humanities communities, video conferencing facilitated holding international events and local plenary discussions alike with little effort to great effect: Students could interact with internationally acclaimed researchers, and regular remote meetings emerged quickly.

Remote collaboration is not limited to video conferencing, however. As workplaces can be understood as a collection of tools for particular tasks of work---physical or virtual---video conferencing does not facilitate the use collaborative use of actual tools. By transmitting changes on a collaborative piece of work and the state of the respective tools, progress can be achieved remotely in a shared workspace between colleagues [@dourish1992; @schwartz1998]. @tang1991 outline the modalities of a collectively shared workspace in a patent that describes the synchronization of an application shared among multiple remote screens. Focusing on requirements for remote environments, @dourish1992 highlight further characteristics of shared workspaces that are being accessed by colleagues remotely. Namely, the concept of _shared feedback_ suggests shifting users' awareness towards operations executed by others on the underlying workspace. With positive feedback on meetings held remotely in academia, this leaves us with many possible benefits for real-time collaborative environments. Particularly the prospects and the accessibility of local-first applications make realizing such environments approachable.

Instead of developing a novel annotation environment---which would have extended the scope of this thesis---I've set out to find an existing environment for a major reason: To learn about peoples' habits when collaborating with digital tools, arbitrary design choices in the UI should be a minor factor. Already established environments commonly received feedback from their users and adjusted its UI and UX to their users' needs. Among various candidates such as Hypothes.is and the Mirador IIIF viewer, I've chosen the Recogito annotation tool as the setting for this study and as proof-of-concept for further experimenting with integrating peer-to-peer annotation storage. Among the requirements---documentation, Web Annotation interoperability, collaboration, popularity---, Recogito scored well:

* **Technical and academic documentation:** The Recogito team has published about the development process [@simon2015; @simon2017] and the source code of Recogito is available publicly[^recogito-repo]. The web application's user interface is extensible, as it is written in JavaScript for browser use. While Pelagios provides an official instance of Recogito[^recogito-pelagios], providing an own instance by using the Docker[^docker] container virtualization environment is supported. Additionally, the team behind Recogito has been responsive and supported us while setting up our own instance as well as transferring data over to Pelagios' official instance.
* **Web Annotation interoperability:** While Recogito does not support an external annotation storage, its annotation data model is _partially compliant_ with the Web Annotation data model. This would be of importance for eventual later stages of this project, when trying to integrate P2P storage into the annotation environment.
* **Collaborative workflows:** With Recogito, resources can be shared with other users, allowing for collaborative annotation. I'll discuss Recogito's collaboration functionality below.
* **Annotation capabilities:** Recogito provides an environment for annotating textual resources, including classic Greek or Latin texts, and annotating images. Furthermore, users can import canonical resources from CTS repositories and IIIF manifests. With a focus on georeferencing, Recogito emphasizes the usage of Linked Data references for annotations.
* **Popularity:** Usage of Recogito is widespread among some Digital Humanities communities. Over the course of this thesis, the number of signed-up users went up to 5.000. Picking a renowned tool for the user testing has had a high priority, as finding collaborating scholars with proficiency in using that tool was easier. 

After reaching out to scholars with a background on Digital Humanities and digital annotation, Chiara Palladino, Assistant Professor of Classics at Furman University, USA, announced interest on launching a joint project on this matter. Chiara Palladino teaches Classics with a focus on Digital Humanities and, as a member of the Pelagios Commons, previously conducted research on the use of LOD tools in the classroom[^chiara-lod-post]. She motivated a group of undergraduate students at Furman University to participate in the study and managed both study sessions overseas. While I designed this study as a part of this thesis, Chiara Palladino and I collaborate on a forthcoming open publication including the students' annotations and notes on the overall feedback. This publication will be accompanied by an article on the Pelagios blog[^pelagios-blog].

Notably, Recogito allows researchers to collaborate and annotate resources on a shared workspace. However, collaboration is only supported to the extend that users have to refresh the website in order to see other's changes; collaboration on Recogito currently lacks the real-time transmission of data as considered by @dourish1992 and @schwartz1998. This leaves room for research on how such real-time capabilities could impact user experience. For the matter of this study we certainly focused on the existing modalities of collaboration:

* **Digital workflow:** How do users actually behave during real-time collaboration? What are their micro-actions and patterns that emerge when there are no real-time updates? How often do they revisit others' work? 
* **Individual experience:** How have users' experience been like? How did they perceive the collaboration in a combined  online and offline setting?

In order to learn about these experiences and achieve further insights into the more complex aspects of collaboration, we have collected qualitative and quantitative feedback alike---some of which gathered implicitly, some explicitly. First, in order to learn the qualitative aspects of collaboration, we have handed out feedback questionnaires to participants asking about their individual experience using Likert-scale type and open-ended questions. I will describe these questionnaires in @sec:study:framework alongside the distinctive framework of the study. Implicit insights were gathered by tracking participants' workflows digitally during study sessions, which provided us with quantitative data on their concrete workflows and interactions. The technology behind this approach is outlined in @sec:study:tracking. Finally, I will discuss results from explicit questionnaire feedback and learnings from the tracking data.

The explorative nature of this study leaves room for discussion with regard to its reproducibility and observed effects. In the later chapter \ref{sec:discussion}, I will voice some possible concerns and an outlook to future work.

## Study Framework {#sec:study:framework}

The study framework consists of six basic components: three questionnaires (demographic survey, first post-session survey, second post-session survey), a modified, self-hosted instance of Recogito, as well as two distinct study sessions during which participants are asked to annotate collaboratively. The questionnaires are partly inspired by a usability questionnaire design called User Experience Questionnaire, or short UEQ [@laugwitz2008]. The UEQ framework emphasizes feedback on the ergonomic and hedonic qualities of a piece of software and has been designed to quickly assess experiences of users. In the following, I will discuss the above components in their chronological order.

Prior to being admitted to the study, each potential participant had to submit an initial survey asking about demographic information such as age and education level. Additionally, this survey posed questions about participants' past habits of annotating digitally as well as on paper, and whether they used Recogito before. All surveys of this study have been created on Google Forms[^google-forms] and have been distributed to all participants via email prior to each session.

The actual study consisted of two distinct sessions during which participants were asked to collaboratively annotate resources. Prior to the session, they have been provided with the URL of a website running a modified version of Recogito, as well as an individual account on this Recogito instance. On this instance, resources fitting the educational background of the participants have been ingested and shared with all accounts working on that resource.

During both sessions, all participants were to be present in the same room with each a computer in front of them and a web browser running, pointing to said Recogito instance. Each session lasted about 60 minutes, with the supervisors present in the room or remotely via video. During the first ten minutes of a session, one supervisor was to give a short introduction at the subject of the session, followed by an opportunity for participants to raise questions. Most notably, in order to ensure the open-ended, creative, and collaborative aspect of this study, we posed little limitations on the participants, as I will illustrate in the following @sec:study:setting.

After the introduction, participants were asked to start working for about 45 minutes while being monitored by the supervisors. During the first sessions, participants received the task of making themselves comfortable with the given resource and the annotation environment of Recogito. They were instructed to work collaboratively and annotate each their resource with textual annotations, given the constraint that one needs to reload the website in order to show others' latest annotations.

Subsequent to the first session, participants were asked to fill out the first post-session questionnaire regarding their experience of working with Recogito in a collaborative environment. This questionnaire is detailed in @sec:questionnaires and asked participants about their work during the session ("Did you interact with others' annotations while working on the document?") and posed questions on experience-related sentiments as Likert-scale questions ("How interactive did the process of annotating collaboratively feel to you?"). 

The second session, taking place less than a month after the first one, had a focus on the particular task of georeferencing, i.e., annotating words or areas---in a text or image resource, respectively---with entities of historic places, such as Athens in Ancient Greece. This task requires to have the respective gazetteers available ingested[^recogito-gazetteers] into Recogito before the session takes place. The selected gazetteer should provide places matching the contents epoch of the selected resources. The session itself has been scheduled similar to the first meeting, with a total duration of 60 minutes including a 15 minutes introduction. This time, participants were explicitly asked to explore the capabilities of georeferencing and were shown the interactive mapping visualization of Recogito. Additionally, supervisors suggested the participants to revisit their previous annotations, as well as the annotations of others, as the group continued to work on the resources and thus, the annotations, they edited during the first session.

The second questionnaire emphasized feedback on the participants' scholarly experience with georeferencing and their user experience Recogito. The questionnaire is provided in @sec:questionnaires. Focusing on georeferencing, the first part of the questionnaire asked participants about their performance on the given tasks throughout the second session and posed questions on georeferencing in particular ("How beneficial was georeferencing places in annotations for your further understanding?"). Given that users had spent two sessions working with Recogito, the second part of the questionnaire asked participants about the ergonomic and hedonic qualities of Recogito, as introduced by the UEQ. Likert-scale type questions asked about participants experience on comprehensibility, innovation, attractiveness, pragmatics, clutter, and creativity of Recogito.

[^google-forms]: Google Forms is a free service by Google that allows users to create surveys in their web browsers: <https://www.google.com/forms/about/>. Google Forms surveys can be distributed with each their unique URL and results are stored on Google Drive, Google's cloud file storage.
[^recogito-gazetteers]: Recogito allows to import collections of referenceable places called gazetteers: <https://github.com/pelagios/recogito2/wiki/Importing-Gazetteers>. The import should be scheduled well ahead of the second session, as the import of large gazetteers will take a while for Recogito to process.

## Tracking Digital Workflows {#sec:study:tracking}

In order to evaluate the _actual_ use of a particular tool while performing tasks, the actions of participants can be recorded. @tang1991 have utilized video recordings of joint collaborative tasks during study sessions, but as our setting was designed to be not limiting participants' creativity and the expected sample size has been relatively large---it would be hard to make out an individuals' actions in a group of ten people or more---, video recording was not suitable for this study. Instead, we opted for real-time aggregation of particular user interactions. Modeling these interactions during an annotation workflow in Recogito as timestamped atomic actions enabled us to reconstruct each participant's actions afterwards. 

![Workflow for (collaborative) annotation in Recogito. The workflow consists of six actions: initialization (1), creation (2), opening (3), editing (4), closing (5), and deleting (6). While opening or creating  will open the annotation editor overlay window, editing, closing, or deleting will close this window and reveal the underlying resource.](figures/recogito-workflow.png){#fig:recogito-workflow short-caption="Workflow for annotation in Recogito"}

![Annotating classic Greek texts on Recogito. Annotations are distinctively highlighted in the source (a). When clicking such highlights, an annotation editor overlay appears (b), where users can add, edit, and delete related annotations.](figures/recogito-editor.png){#fig:recogito-editor short-caption="Annotating classic Greek texts on Recogito"}

When annotating, an editing overlay appears above the source, which is pictured in @fig:recogito-editor. The derived annotation workflow is visualized in @fig:recogito-workflow and consists of the following six events:

* **Initialization:** An `init` event gets tracked when Recogito initializes, i.e., either when opening a resource in Recogito after selecting it from the browser or reloading the annotation environment of that resource.
* **Create annotation:** A `create` event gets tracked when a user creates a _new_ annotation on the current resource.
* **Open annotation:** An `open` event gets tracked when a user accesses an _existing_ annotation on the current resource, which will open an editing overlay for that annotation in Recogito (pictured in @fig:recogito-editor). This event is getting tracked independently of who created the annotation.
* **Edit annotation:** An `edit` event gets tracked when a user edits an existing annotation independently of its creator. Within the context of Recogito, editing entails either the original annotation, adding a subordinate annotation to this annotation, editing a subordinate annotation, or deleting a subordinate annotation.
* **Close annotation:** A `close` event gets tracked when a user closes the editing overlay for an annotation.
* **Delete annotation:** A `delete` event gets tracked when a user deletes a parent annotation (and thus, any subordinate annotation).

For tracking these, we adapted parts of Recogito to our needs. As the UI of Recogito is written in JavaScript, we could easily identify the modules controlling Recogito's annotation editor and inject function calls to send the respective events to a backend server via HTTPS. Such an event---depicted in @lst:tracking-event---would include the event type, the acting user's ID, a timestamp, and the respective annotation to which the the event is related. On the server, a HTTP server written in JavaScript, too, and running on the Node.js runtime, would receive the events and insert them as JSON-encoded entry into a CouchDB[^couchdb] NoSQL database. In that database, all events would remain for later evaluation.

Listing: Example JSON-encoded excerpt of a tracking event after querying from the CouchDB database. In this event, `user1` opens an annotation created by `user2`.

```{.js #lst:tracking-event}

      }
    ]
  },
  "timestamp": 1575310649165
}
```

For evaluating the events, we utilized two contemporary approaches for interactive notebooks. The Jupyter[^jupyter] notebook environment with a Node.js-based kernel[^ijavascript]for exploring the vast amount of events recorded during both study sessions [@kassel2020b]. After providing the notebook with a JSON-encoded dump of the CouchDB database used for storing events, it will guide users through preparation and processing of the data and ultimately present key insights into participants' workflows, as detailed in the results section below. With browser-based notebooks on Observable[^observable], we then generated visual insights into survey feedback we received from participants by exporting the Google Forms survey feedback to CSV-based data and processing it with D3[^d3].

## Setting and Observations {#sec:study:setting}

Through her teaching at Furman University, Chiara Palladino recruited a group of students who were interested in participating in the study. They have been offered extra credits on their coursework when participating in both sessions and providing the required feedback. A group of size $n = 11$ students with various backgrounds such as classics, politics, and social sciences signed up for the study. The students had diverse experience with annotation: All of them were undergraduate students at Furman University and almost all of them frequently annotate resources by hand. When asked about their use of real-time collaboration software such as Google Docs, a majority stated a frequent use of such software with a varying degree of collaboration. Annotating documents digitally was less common, as just 54.5% of the students stated that they use digital annotation at least infrequently. None of them had any prior experience with Recogito itself.

During both sessions, the students worked all together in the Common Room of the classics department at Furman University, which is accommodated with a large screen and a table with multiple chairs. Students have been asked to bring their own laptops and install recent versions of the Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome browsers for ensuring compatibility with Recogito. To ensure their anonymity while filling out surveys, the students each were asked to pick a unique identifier consisting of alphanumerical characters. Additionally, the students had to sign up for an account on a private website running a modified version of Recogito; the account name was required to match said identifier. We provided two sources for them to work on during the sessions, both of which they were free to choose from:

* _Catalogue of Ships_[^ships]: A Greek text passage from Homer's _Iliad_. 
* _Tabula Peutingeriana_[^tabula]: A digital reconstruction of an ancient Roman roadmap of the same name. We imported the eleven segments of the map and added them to Recogito as a single collection of images. 

For the task of georeferencing, we ingested the Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire [@ahlfeldt2013] into Recogito, providing students with plenty of resources for geospatial annotation.

Throughout both sessions, we mostly follwed the previously detailed study framework. After the students received a basic introduction on their sources and their structure, and a very short tutorial on how to use Recogito, they were told the assignments for each session. During the first session, they were instructed to primarily look for named entities in their sources and transcribe or translate them with appropriate tags, followed by the particular task of georeferencing in the second session. They were supervised by Chiara Palladino on-site and monitored by me remotely via video, yet the assignment was expressed very lose, enabling them to interact within each other and collaboratively explore the modalities of digital annotation. As an immediate reward, we provided everyone with pizza.

## Results {#sec:study:results}

The recorded tracking data showed that the students collaborated with each other offline---i.e., verbally---as well as online. The telemetry system collected 3.029 events throughout both sessions, of which 1.218 events have been recorded during the first and 1.811 events during the second session. They have created an accumulated corpus of 692 annotations on both sources, of which a majority of 559 has been created during the first session. Initializations---i.e., receiving others' latest changes by reloading the website---occured 166 times during the first session and 74 times during the second one.

Records that are related to digital collaboration, however, indicate significant differences between both sessions: During the first session, no annotations have been edited collaboratively---i.e., created by one user and edited by another---and students viewed others' annotations just 70 times. This changed during the second session, where students viewed others' annotations 901 times and issued 82 edits on existing annotations. This difference can hint at the use of preexisting annotations during the second run, whereas students initially started their work on an empty workspace during the first session. This disparity could hint at a change in workflows once the shared workspace is filled with content; the students' actions shifted from creating towards editing annotations between both sessions. This shift shows the lack of editable data during the first session, which could hint at prospects for collaborative annotation workflows: Given that changes are transmitted in real-time, users could become aware of others' work and inspect it immediately.

![Results of the feedback questionnaires. Questions on the collaboration experience (Q1-4) have been posed after the first session, while questions on the user experience with Recogito and georeferencing (Q5-11) have been posed after the second session.](figures/study-results.pdf){#fig:study-results short-caption="Results of the feedback questionnaires"}

The questionnaires result hint at a mostly positive feedback in regard to collaborative annotation on Recogito, whether collaborating online or offline. Results of experience-related questions are pictured in @fig:study-results. While the students were divided into two groups---one working on the Latin map, the other working on the Greek text---I will treat them as a singular group in the following; except for the difference in group sizes, the text and image annotation modalities on Recogito are similar and the study environment did not change in any regard.

The first questionnaire asked the students about their general experience with annotating collaborative in general. Particucarly in an offline setting, participants could feel intimidated by others voicing their ideas---which also counts for online communities---, but the students assured a neutral sentiment between intrusion and overprotection (Q2). They furthermore stated an enthuasiastic and energetic environment (Q1 and Q3), which reflects their activity during the first session. Occasional chats of students possibly account for perception of a quite talkative environment (Q4), as opposed to potential isolation in a remote environment. Despite the previously noted low indicators on digital collaboration during the first session, all students stated that they interacted with others, with 91.7% reading others' annotations and 25% receiving information from others on annotations created by them. 

The second questionnaire yields more profound feedback on the user experience of Recogito and on georeferencing in particular. The students continued their work on the previous session's annotations and about 50% of them stated that they created more than 15 georeferences. However, some students have not been able to reference places due to duplicate or missing locations---e.g., the island of Crete was not included on the gazetteer. Yet, georeferencing has received positive feedback since students found it mostly helpful (Q11) and stated it helped them to understand the source spatially (100%), to understand its sources (81.8%), and even to communicate knowledge with fellow students (54.5%). Reporting on their experiences with using Recogito, they found the user interface intuitive (Q10) and visually pleasant (Q8) while neither stripped-down nor overcharged (Q6). This feedback alings with their ability to get to know Recogito quickly during the first session and creating such a large corpus of annotation during the first session.

The overall feedback hints at promising outcomes when using Recogito in classrooms: The environment has been evaluated as intuitive and pragmatic, leaving students the possibility to explore sources in a spatial representation with novel modalities for structuring and communicating knowledege. Recogito clearly shows how collaborative use of tools in the DH---whether online or offline---can be used in teaching and research for gaining spatial insights into resources by leveraging LOD datasets.

Evaluating the digital records, however, reveal opportunities its collaboration capabilities. Annotating resources is a semi-synchronous task, arguably, due to the fact that it requires focused, solitary insights into the underlying sources. While annotating a resource, focus is an important facilitator of the intellectual process. @dourish1992 anticipate the overhead of _informational awareness_ and emphasize considerate use of communication channels depending on the nature of the workspace, whether conducted privately or shared publicly. The results of this study clearly show a two-fold lack of awareness on collaborative operations on Recogito if used in a shared workspace that is used synchronously: First, the workspace _content_ is not synchronized in real-time. Second, if changes of others were to be synchronized, Recogito lacked the presentation of other users' activities. In the following chapters, I will outline theoretical and technical modalities for realizing real-time collaborative annotation while focusing on architectural aspects of data ownership.

In a joint follow-up publication, Chiara Palladino, the participating students, and I will provide the curated dataset from both sessions, with summarized insights into the results presented above as well as personal insights by the students.
