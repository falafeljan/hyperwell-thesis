# User Testing Study {#sec:study}

_TODO:_ Introduce into the study environment:

* Reason to do this study: Explore how people commonly collaborate with online tools
* Why use Recogito? It's open source software. It can be self-hosted. It supports annotation of various materials. It's a popular tool for Classics and Digital Humanities research. The team has been communicative. It's commonly used, so finding classes for this study would have been easier. Chiara Palladino from Furman University is a member of the Pelagios initiative and related to Recogito.
  * Highlight that Recogito currently does not provide real-time collaboration, and requires a refresh of the website in order to display fresh work of collaborators.
* It became a collaborative venture between Chiara and me, and resulted in an open publication as well as a blog post on the Pelagios blog, with an emphasis on using Recogito in the classroom.
* Aspects we wanted to learn about:
  * Digital workflow: How do users actually behave during real-time collaboration, what are their micro-actions and patterns that emerge when there is no real-time update, how often do they revisit others' work?
  * Learning curve
  * Explore their personal experiences with the sessions; how did they perceive the collaboration in an online & offline way

## Study Design {#sec:study:design}

* Duration & Schedule of sessions
* Focus of each session
* Explicit feedback via surveys on Google Forms 
  * Type of feedback questions (open-ended, Likert scale, ...)
* Materials used: Iliads Map of Ships (Greek text) & Tabula Peutingeriana (map)

### Technical Evaluation

* Docker setup
* Telemetry/tracking setup (API, SDK, database)
* Implementing tracking into Recogito
* Evaluation of all tracking data via Jupyter Notebooks (with a Node.js backend)

## Setting and Testing Group {#sec:study:setting}

* Liberal setting during class (although it has not been _regular_ class for students)
* Testing group has been a group of X students; mostly freshmen and -women at Furman University. While a majority of them had stated an experience with digital annotation and collaboration (e.g., Google Docs)
* Students have been compensated with extra credits when "successfully" participating---that means, being present on all sessions.
* Students have been sitting on a single large desk at some room of the Furman University Classics department.
* I have been present via video; more specificially, my video stream was being played back on a big screen directly in front of that table.
* Students have been talking during both sessions; even more, they were encouraged to collaborate physically (by talking---not using others' computers) and creating annotations, exploring the user interface

## Results {#sec:study:results}

_TODO:_ To be continued. I didn't yet calculate final results and formulate hypotheses. However, these should be applied to one of the implementations of @sec:implementation, and be discussed further in @sec:discussion.

_TODO:_ Open publication containing the students' work; exported into various formats. However, Recogito is yet missing an import functionality that is easily accessible.

_TODO:_ Verbal feedback of the students that we've gathered for that publication (just cite the blog post).
