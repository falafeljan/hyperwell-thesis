## Future Work

Future prospects:
* Leverage Linked Data prospects even further. Especially in the Notebook application, Linked Data could be used to interact with a resource as whole---for instance, when doing georeferencing. Web Annotations can provide an intent and a type, so the application could provide various modes of visualization.
* Linked Data Notifications
* Resource Discovery: While working on the 'thick peer' approach, a discovery mechanism has been developed for the protocol that has been used in this particular approach: Users working on a resource could easily spot other users' notebooks that target this resource.
