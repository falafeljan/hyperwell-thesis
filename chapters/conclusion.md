# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

In this thesis, I have argued that personal data and particularly annotations are not treated accordingly on the web. Local-first applications pose a viable solution for increasing both digital ownership and privacy, effectively facilitating the modalities of private collaboration. This could benefit workflows in Digital Humanities, as scholars commonly annotate sources. An explorative study on the aspects of collaborative annotation in Digital Humanities software hinted at prospects for real-time collaboration capabilities, while it also manifested the need for supporting the web and LOD. 

Subsequently, I have conceived two types of architectures for incorporating both clients on the web and local-first applications via P2P networks. Both attempts were complemented with implementations, yet the second attempt called Hyperwell proved itself a viable solution for balancing autonomy on P2P networks and determinism on the web. With some parts of Hyperwell still in the making, future work on Hyperwell could integrate LD infrastructure with P2P technology even more to ensure interoperability with the web's LDP. For realizing such workflows in the academic context, studies on the usability of P2P applications and collaborative aspects of shared workspaces could further support the development of collaborative, decentralized applications.
